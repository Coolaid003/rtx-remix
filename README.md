# RTX-Remix

A runtime engine for adding path-tracing to classic games.

The runtime itself consists of multiple technologies, each with its own git repo.  This combined repo references those technologies via submodules, at the specific commits that make up the current stable [release](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix/releases).


## Contributions

All contributions should be directed towards the individual technology repos (below), this repo is just tying it all together in one place.  

Contributions accepted to any of the submodules will eventually make it into a release.  We'll be aiming to push those out on a monthly basis.
